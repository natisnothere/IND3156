Before I say anything about this project, github is trash and you will only be able to see the bare code because of this. There will be a second folder with notes explaining what the original files achieve and how. I will include links to the resources that I used.

Before starting the project I looked into types of code that translate from computer, phone, and tablet well with intentions to make this project into a phone application. HTML5 was the one that works well between all three and one that I was a little bit familiar with but didn't know a lot about. I refamiliarized myself with basic HTML through a past project thus I do not have the resource for making a HTML site and formating it with CSS.
